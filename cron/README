Achievo crontab scripts
=======================

Achievo contains some scripts that you can run from cron to perform
certain actions or checks.

To be able to use these scripts, you need to have the php cgi-binary on your
system.


General instructions
--------------------
If you want to use one of the scripts, edit your crontab (crontab -e on
most Unix systems), and add a line in the form of:

0 9 * * tue   cd /var/www/achievo; /usr/bin/php runcron todo.reminder > /dev/null

This will run the reminder.cron script from the todo module every Tuesday
morning at 9 o'clock.

(assuming your php binary is in /usr/bin and Achievo is installed in
/var/www/, if this is not the case, change the values accordingly.)


Available scripts
-----------------
Currently, the following scripts can be used from cron:

* timereg.reminder

   This script checks if all users have registered enough hours in the
   previous week.
   It compares the number of hours in the contract of that user with the
   number of hours actually booked. If the number of booked hours is not
   enough, an email reminder is sent to that user.

   Note: This script always counts the hours in the previous week from
   Monday to Sunday, regardless of the day on which you run the script. This
   means you can run the script multiple times a week, so people will be
   reminded more than once if they keep forgetting to register their hours.

   Suggested run frequency: once or twice a week.
   Suggested run time: Monday morning (and the second one on Wednesday
                       morning)

* todo.reminder

   This script sends reminders to people if they have one or more todo's
   open, that are due today, or that are overdue. A cc is sent to the owner
   of the todo.
   If a user has more than one todo assigned, the todos are grouped in a
   single mail per owner, to prevent users from being spammed with lots
   of todo reminders.

   Suggested run frequency: daily
   Suggested run time: in the morning, just before office opening time.

* employee.usercontracts

   This script checks if there are any usercontracts are about to expire
   in a specified amount of time. If such users are found an email is sent
   to one (or more) specified mailaddresses. More information in configuration
   file achievo/configs/employee.inc.php

   Suggested run frequency: In mode 1: daily
                            In mode 2: weekly
   Suggested run time: In mode 1: daily at 12:00
                       In mode 2: Monday morning

* project.deliverables:

   The deliverables script checks for deliverables that have neared or
   reached the due date. If such a deliverable is found, an e-mail is sent
   to the project coordinator of the project to which the deliverable
   belongs.

   Suggested run frequency: daily
   Suggested run time: in the morning, just before office opening time.

* organization.expiredcontracts:

   This script checks if there are any active contracts that have expired. 
   If one or more of those contracts is found the status is changed to
   the 'archived' status. Then the script checks if there are any active
   projects linked to this contract and sets this status to 'nonactive'.
   The new status for the contract and project is configurable.
   It is possible to send a warning mail to a specified user when the cronjob 
   performs such an action (configurable).
   The script can be configured to check for an extra field for a specific 
   value in the contract table selecting expired contracts.
   The configuration file can be found at achievo/configs/organization.inc.php.
   
   Suggested run frequency: daily
   Suggested run time: in the morning, just before office opening time.
   
Add-on modules
--------------

Add-on modules may have their own useful cron scripts. These are usually
located in the cron subdirectory of the module. They can be run using
runcron, like above.

Example: suppose you have a module 'mymodule' with a file 'dailycheck.cron'
in its cron/ subdirectory. You can run this script by adding this to your
crontab:

0 9 * * *   cd /var/www/achievo; /usr/bin/php runcron mymodule.dailycheck

Note that the '.cron' extension of the filename does not need to be passed
to the runcron script.
