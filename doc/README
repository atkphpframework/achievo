Getting involved
----------------
Achievo is developed in an Open Source (http://www.opensource.org) fashion in
order to facilitate collaboration on the project. One of the reasons for
choosing the Open Source method is to ensure that development is not limited
by our own resources alone.
We can also use some help in doing translations of the software and
documentation writing. If you're creative, we can also use themes.
If you want to help development, join our mailinglist by sending an empty
message to achievo-subscribe@achievo.com. If you don't like mailinglists
you can also send an email to ivo@achievo.com with your suggestions.


User documentation
------------------
Currently no user documentation is provided for Achievo. Once the project has
reached a certain level of maturity, we will start providing user documentation
until that time, if you have any questions, join the mailinglist by sending an
empty message to achievo-subscribe@achievo.com
