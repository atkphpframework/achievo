  userprefs node class. Themes without a themedef.inc file also won't
  be included in the getThemes result anaymore. [Guido]

    or the status is completed). [Sandy]
  * 'assigned to' only shows active users in the dropdown (bug 667) [Sandy]
  * When you create a private todo it's still possible to assign it to
    somebody else. Only the owner and assigned to will see it. [Sandy]
  * The admin screen has a new action completed, it will set the todo to 100%
    and status 'completed' [Sandy]
