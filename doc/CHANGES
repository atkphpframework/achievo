+ In user preferences->pim we can't select the pim items that we don't have 
  access to. To add checking access right to pim item, add the following method 
  to your module:
  function getPimRights()
  {
    return array("pimitemname"=>array('realnode','realaction'));
  }
  After this only user with right 'realaction' for node 'realnode' can select
  "pimitemname" for adding to pim page. [Yury]
