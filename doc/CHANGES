  userprefs node. [Guido]
* Optimized the getThemes function a little bit and moved it into the
  userprefs node class. Themes without a themedef.inc file also won't
  be included in the getThemes result anaymore. [Guido]

    'completed'. [Sandy]
  + Added closedate field (will be filled when the todo is completed for 100%
    or the status is completed). [Sandy]
  * 'assigned to' only shows active users in the dropdown (bug 667) [Sandy]
  * When you create a private todo it's still possible to assign it to
    somebody else. Only the owner and assigned to will see it. [Sandy]
  * The admin screen has a new action completed, it will set the todo to 100%
    and status 'completed' [Sandy]
