Upgrading Achievo
=================
Read this first

Despite our best efforts to keep this file as accurate as possible, 
there might be situations in which the described procedure does not 
work. If this happens, please see the Support section of the 
../README.md file. 

IMPORTANT
---------
Upgrading is never without risk. ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR ACHIEVO DATABASE 
before attempting to upgrade (e.g. using mysqldump). A good way to do 
the upgrade is to copy the entire database. For example, if your 
database is achievo_0_6 and you want to upgrade to Achievo 1.4, copy the 
achievo_0_6 database to achievo_1_4 and then proceed with the 
instructions below. 

General upgrade instructions
============================
These are the general upgrade instructions. Sometimes, additional 
information is provided for upgrading between certain versions. You will 
find this additional information at the end of this document. 

Upgrading the software usually consists of replacing the Achievo 
sourcecode with a newer version. It is usually possible to use the 
config file from your current Achievo installation. However, by doing 
this you might miss config options added in the newer release. 
Therefore, the best practice is to use the new configfile and change the 
necessary settings again (you may find diff'ing the config files useful).

As of Achievo 0.9.2, a setup.php script is provided to upgrade Achievo
databases. Take the following steps to perform the upgrade:

1) Make sure the config.inc.php file is correct, especially the database
   configuration and the administrator password.

   Important: in order to upgrade your database, the databaseuser used by
   Achievo needs to have the following privileges on the Achievo database:
   select, insert, update, delete, lock tables, create, alter and create view.
   It is ok to remove the create and alter table privileges after the upgrade
   process is completed.

2) Point your browser to the setup.php script. For example, browse to:

   http://yourserver/achievo/setup.php (assuming Achievo is installed in the
   directory 'achievo' in your webservers' document root.)

   You will be presented with a login screen. You need to login as
   administrator, with the password you specified in config.inc.php.

3) The setup.php script will take you through the upgrade process. It will
   verify if PHP is configured correctly to run this version of Achievo, and
   migrate your database if necessary. Follow the directions on screen until
   the script tells you that the upgrade is complete.

Additional upgrade notes
========================
This section contains information that you should read when upgrading to or
from a particular version of Achievo.

Upgrading from Achievo 0.4.x
----------------------------
Since Achievo 0.4, the authentication and authorization processes have changed
significantly. If you upgrade from an Achievo version 0.4.x, there are a few
things to note:
- All passwords are reset to 'default'. Users should change their passwords
  after their first login.
- Access rights can not be preserved between these versions. After the
  upgrade, you should go the the Employees menu, and edit the Security
  Profiles. By default, all users present in Achievo 0.4 are placed in the
  'Default Group' profile.
