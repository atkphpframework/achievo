Upgrading Achievo

Depite our efforts to keep this UPGRADE file as accurate as possible, there
might be situations in which the described procedure does not work.
In this case send an email to ivo@achievo.org or to the mailinglist
(achievo@achievo.org) and we will try to help you out.

IMPORTANT
---------
Upgrading is never without risk. ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR ACHIEVO DATABASE before
attempting to upgrade. A good way to do the upgrade is to copy the entire 
database. For example, if your database is achievo_0_6, and you want to 
upgrade to Achievo 0.8, then copy the database to achievo_0_8. Then proceed
with the instructions below.

Support
-------
Upgrading is not always easy, especially if you need to upgrade to a version
that is significantly newer than your current version. Ibuildings.nl can help
with the conversion. For information about this kind of support, see:

General upgrade instructions
============================

These are the general upgrade instructions. Sometimes, additional information
is provided for upgrading between certain versions. You will find this 
additional information at the end of this document.

Upgrading the software usually consists of replacing the Achievo sourcecode 
with a newer version. It is usually possible to use the config file from your
current Achievo installation, however, you might miss some config options that
were added in a newer release. Therefor it is best to use the new configfile 
and just change the settings again.

As of Achievo 0.9.2, a setup.php script is provided to upgrade Achievo 
databases. Take the following steps to perform the upgrade:

1) Make sure the config.inc.php file is correct, especially the database 
   configuration and the administrator password.

   Important: in order to upgrade your database, the databaseuser used by 
   Achievo needs to have the following privileges on the Achievo database: 
   select, insert, update, delete, create and alter. 
   It is ok to remove the create and alter table privileges after the upgrade 
   process is completed.

2) Point your browser to the setup.php script. For example, browse to:
    
   http://yourserver/achievo/setup.php (assuming Achievo is installed in the
   directory 'achievo' in your webservers' document root.)
   
   You will be presented with a login screen. You need to login as 
   administrator, with the password you specified in config.inc.php.

3) The setup.php script will take you through the upgrade process. It will 
   verify if PHP is configured correctly to run this version of Achievo, and 
   migrate your database if necessary. Follow the directions on screen until 
   the script tells you that the upgrade is complete.
  

Additional upgrade notes
========================

This section contains information that you should read when upgrading to or 
from a particular version of Achievo.

Upgrading from Achievo 0.4.x
----------------------------
Since Achievo 0.4, the authentication and authorization processes have changed
significantly. If you upgrade from an Achievo version 0.4.x, there are a few
things to note:
- All passwords are reset to 'default'. Users should change their passwords 
  after their first login.
- Access rights can not be preserved between these versions. After the 
  upgrade, you should go the the Employees menu, and edit the Security 
  Profiles. By default, all users present in Achievo 0.4 are placed in the 
  'Default Group' profile.
