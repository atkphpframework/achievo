Achievo Frequently Asked Questions
==================================

If you have a question about Achievo, try to find the answer below.
If you can't find it, mail your question to the Achievo mailinglist.

Note: In the answers below, we sometimes refer to menu items or fields in 
Achievo. We use the english terms, so if you use a different language, 
the terms might be different.

Note 2: The FAQ is targeted at the latest stable release of Achievo.
        If you run a development version, things might have changed.

1. Installation 
---------------

 1.1. I have installed Achievo, and I am getting the following error:
      "Fatal error: Call to unsupported or undefined function 
       mysql_pconnect()"

        Make sure you installed MySQL, and check if you enabled MySQL 
        support in PHP. If you built PHP from source, this means you have
        to recompile it with MySQL support (Check the PHP documentation for
        instructions on how to do this). 
        If you installed PHP from rpms, you have to install the corresponding 
        php-mysql rpm.

 1.2. I have installed Achievo, and I am getting the following error:
      "Warning: open(/tmp\sess_22a61bffada1208843753014b4d6f0ac, O_RDWR) 
       failed: No such file or directory (2) in 
       c:\path_to_achievo\atk\session\class.atksessionmanager.inc on line 14"
      (or something very similar)
      
        This could be caused by two things, either of which is a PHP 
        misconfiguration:
        - the session.save_path directory in php.ini is set to a directory
          that doesn't exist, or
        - the dir pointed to by session.save_path is not readable and writable
          by the webserver.          

 1.3. Does Achievo run on Windows?
 
        Yes it does. You can either run it on Apache with PHP as a module, or
        with MS Internet Information Server, running PHP as an ISAPI 
        extension.
 
 

2. Logging in to Achievo
------------------------

 2.1. What is the password for the Achievo demo on your site?
 
        The username is 'administrator', the password is 'demo'.

 2.2. I just installed Achievo for the first time and I try to login. 
      What's the username and password?   
   
        The username is 'administrator', the default password is 'demo'.
   
 2.3. How can I change the administrator password?
 
        The administrator password is set in the config.inc.php file, not in
        the database.      
        
 2.4. I am absolutely sure I have the correct username and password, but I 
      still can't login to Achievo. It keeps presenting the login box, no 
      matter what I enter, or I get a "Failed to logon" message.
      
        There are several things that could cause this behaviour. Here are the
        known causes, in order of probability:
        
        a) You are not using the correct username and password. (Yes, 
           'absolutely sure' is a relative term.) Remember that the password
           for 'administrator' is the one set in the config.inc.php file, even
           if you set another password in the database.        
        b) There could be a .htaccess file in the way. Don't put an .htaccess 
           file in Achievo's directory, or above it. If you do this, the login
           box you will see is the one from the .htaccess file, not the one 
           from Achievo.
        
        
  
3. Time Registration
--------------------

 3.1. The dropdown for 'Project/Phase' is empty, but I am sure I created 
      projects and phases.
    
        This is not a bug, this is a feature. The dropdown is like a 'recent 
        documents' option most applications have. It only contains the last
        projects you used, so you can quickly access them. If a project you
        want to use is not in the dropdown, click the link 'Search all 
        projects and phases'.       

 3.2. When I edit an entry, the activity is not set correctly. (Mozilla/
      Netscape 6)

        There is a bug in some Mozilla 0.9.x and Netscape 6.x releases that
        causes this behaviour:
        http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86659
        Mozilla 0.9.4 no longer has this bug, so upgrading Mozilla should 
        help.



4. Add-on Modules
-----------------

 4.1. Where can I find Achievo add-on modules?
 
        You can download modules from http://www.achievo.org/download/modules
        
 4.2. How do I install add-on modules?
  
        This depends on the module. Every module contains a doc directory 
        which contains a file named INSTALL. This INSTALL file describes every
        step you need to take to activate the module.
        
 4.3. I've downloaded and installed the module, but am unable to find new 
      menu-entries. Where can I find the new features?
      
        Usually, new features are only available to users that are granted 
        access. Since users can not grant access to features to which they 
        don't have access themselves, you will need to login as Administrator
        to be able to grant access to other users. Once you've granted access
        to one profile, all users from this profile can access the new 
        feature (and if they have the right to edit profiles, grant access to
        others).



5. General Problems
-------------------

 5.1. I can't save any records (projects, employees or anything else). I get 
      no error messages, but there is no new record after I pressed the 'save'
      button.
      
        There appears to be a problem when using PHP 4.1.2, which results in
        this weird behaviour. The problem is session related, but we don't 
        know the exact cause yet. Upgrading to a newer PHP version solves the 
        problem. If it doesn't, follow the steps described in question 4.3 
        below.
        
 5.2. Achievo is slow. 
 
        Achievo has quite a powerful backend. Unfortunately, the more PHP code
        that is required to run an application, the slower it gets.
        One very good way to speed up any PHP application is to use an 
        accelerator. php-accelerator is free, and we have had very positive
        results with it. You can find it at http://www.php-accelerator.co.uk
        
        We are also constantly improving the speed and efficiency of the 
        backend. Keeping your Achievo installation up to date is a good way
        of improving performance and reducing bugs.
        
 5.3. I can only save one record. After the first record is saved, new records
      are no longer stored.
      
        If you are using MySQL 4.0, make sure you give the LOCK TABLES 
        privilege to the database user.
        
 5.4. I have a problem which is not covered in this FAQ, what should I do?
  
        a) Have a look at the mailinglist archive at 
           http://www.achievo.org/lists. Your problem may have been discussed
           there.
        b) Subscribe to the mailinglist by sending an empty message to
           achievo-subscribe@achievo.org. Send a mail to the list, with the 
           following information:
           - A good description of the problem, if possible with steps to 
             reproduce it.
           - Which version of Achievo, PHP, MySQL and Apache you are using.
        c) If you think you found a bug, please use our bugtracking system at
           http://www.achievo.org/bugzilla to report it. (First search the 
           bug database to make sure your bug is not already reported by 
           someone else.)
